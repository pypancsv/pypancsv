## Python for Spreadsheet Manipulation 102 - Hands-On Training for Salesforce Admins ("Salesforce Saturday")

# Saturday, January 26th
# [11:25AM-2PM CST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20190126T1125&p1=219){:target="_blank"}

This is an online live webcast of a face-to-face training, but I will so my best to monitor the chat for Q&A from online attendees, particularly during designated Q&A times.

# Teaser

PART TWO: this time we'll get to VLOOKUP! Woot!

We'll do a quick recap from "101" (see https://pypancsv.github.io/pypancsv/HandsOn201810/).

We won't go back in depth over programming fundamentals like "what is a variable?" and "what're the implications of running code against a single cell vs. a column vs. a whole subsection of a table?"

But if you're adventurous and missed out last time, join us anyway! Worst you can do is get a little lost.  :-)

> Have you ever dreaded the first of the month because you know there's a CSV or XLSX spreadsheet waiting in your inbox that is going to consume half your day to clean up in Excel, just like it did last month, and the month before that, and the month before that...?
> 
> Python is a programming language that, together with its extension Pandas, has exploded in popularity among "non-programmers" with data to crunch because of its simplicity to write.
> 
> If you are a bit of an "Excel formula geek" or "Salesforce formula field go-to" or "Salesforce Process Builder whiz," YOU CAN DO THIS!
> 
> (Disclaimer: if you toss spreadsheets in terror to your "Excel power-user" coworker, you might find this Salesforce Saturday a bit of a challenge.)
> 
> With a practical focus on real-world Salesforce Admin problems, we'll cover writing and combining spreadsheet edits such as:
> 
> 1. Modifying only cells that meet certain criteria
> 
> 2. Pivoting data into a different shape
> 
> 3. Combining spreadsheets on data they share in common (think "VLOOKUP")
> 
> 4. Looping over every file in a directory, running the same program against each file

# Instructions & Code Snippets You Will Need

## Notes:

* All links you will need start with "https://link.stthomas.edu/**sfpy**..."
* If the "Codebunk" development environment gives you trouble, all "starter code" links can have "-b" _(a hyphen and a lowercase letter b)_ added to the end of them to get the same "starter code" in a slower-but-less-finicky environment called "Repl.it"

...(coming soon)...

## Exercise 1:  Add/Delete/Rename/Reorder Columns Yourself

Open the [https://link.stthomas.edu/sfpy123](https://link.stthomas.edu/sfpy123){:target="_blank"} "starter code."

If this "starter code" had a `print(df1)` command in it, `df1` would look like this to start:

```
      Id    First      Last           Email                      Company
0   5829    Jimmy    Buffet  jb@example.com                          RCA
1   2894  Shirley  Chisholm  sc@example.com       United States Congress
2    294  Marilyn    Monroe  mm@example.com                          Fox
3  30829    Cesar    Chavez  cc@example.com          United Farm Workers
4    827  Vandana     Shiva  vs@example.com                     Navdanya
5   9284   Andrea     Smith  as@example.com     University of California
6    724   Albert    Howard  ah@example.com  Imperial College of Science
```

* _(Remember to "fork" the code before trying to edit it when you first open the starter code.)_
* At the end of the program, add code that modifies the contents of `df1` as follows, and make your last line of code `print(df1)`:
 1. Add a column called `Hello` with the phrase `Yay Us` filled in all the way down
 2. Rename `Last` to `Last Name` and `First` to `First Name`
 3. Delete the `Email` column
 4. Reorder the columns to be `Hello`, `Last Name`, `Company`, `First Name`, & then `Id`.
* You should see the following output:
```
    Hello Last Name                      Company First Name     Id
0  Yay Us    Buffet                          RCA      Jimmy   5829
1  Yay Us  Chisholm       United States Congress    Shirley   2894
2  Yay Us    Monroe                          Fox    Marilyn    294
3  Yay Us    Chavez          United Farm Workers      Cesar  30829
4  Yay Us     Shiva                     Navdanya    Vandana    827
5  Yay Us     Smith     University of California     Andrea   9284
6  Yay Us    Howard  Imperial College of Science     Albert    724
```

Don't forget that:

* You might need to surround column names with single quotes to indicate that they're text, not code
* When typing out a list in your code, you need a pair of square brackets around them to indicate it's a list _(in addition to whatever other square brackets might be present in your code due to Pandas loving square brackets)_

## Cheat Sheet:  Add/Delete/Reorder/Rename Columns

<div id="colcommands-add-1"/>

### Adding columns, approach 1 of 2

```python
dfVarName['ColumnName'] = 'abc'
```

or

```python
dfVarName['UpperCaseFirstName'] = dfVarName['FirstName'].str.upper()
```

etc.

<div id="colcommands-add-2"/>

### Adding columns, approach 2 of 2

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName.assign(ColumnName1 = 'abc', ColumnName2 = 'def')
```

or

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName.assign(UpperCaseFirstName = dfVarName['FirstName'].str.upper(), LowerCaseFirstName = dfVarName['FirstName'].str.lower())
```

etc.

<div id="colcommands-del-1"/>

### Deleting columns, approach 1 of 2 _(keep only columns named)_

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName[['ColumnName1','ColumnName2','ColumnName3']]
```

or

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName[varNameHoldingAListOfColumnNames]
```

etc.

<div id="colcommands-del-2"/>

### Deleting columns, approach 2 of 2 _(discard columns named)_

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName.drop(columns=['ColumnName1','ColumnName2','ColumnName3'])
```

or

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName.drop(columns=varNameHoldingAListOfColumnNames)
```

etc.

<div id="colcommands-reo-1"/>

### Reordering columns

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName[['ColumnName1','ColumnName2','ColumnName3']]
```

or

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName[varNameHoldingAListOfColumnNames]
```

etc.

_(They'll come out in the order you specified.)_


<div id="colcommands-ren-2"/>

### Renaming columns

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName.rename(columns={'ColumnName1':'NewColumnName1','ColumnName2':'NewColumnName2'})
```

or

```python
dfVarName = dfVarName.rename(columns=varNameHoldingAMapOfColumnRenameLogic)
```

etc.

## Door Prize Script:  Dynamic Rename & Reorder

[Tweet me if you use this in real life](https://www.twitter.com/KatieKodes){:target="_blank"} â€“ remember to hashtag #AwesomeAdmin & #YayUs !

This code makes use of intermediate-level Python functionality called "list [comprehensions](https://dbader.org/blog/list-dict-set-comprehensions-in-python){:target="_blank"}" and "dict comprehensions" to build the contents of `columnsWithProgramInTheName` _(a list)_, `theRestOfTheColumns` _(a list)_, and `renamingMap` _(a "dict", which is a data structure to indicate that certain things should "become" other things as specified)_.

They're just concise-to-type "for loops," to be honest.

To build `newColumnOrder` _(a "list")_, this code takes advantage of Python's ridiculously simple grammar for combining two lists:  you just put a "`+`" between them.

What's really neat, though, is that it:

 1. dynamically extracts a list of all columns that have the word `Program` in their name
 2. strips that word from those column names _(a rename)_, and then
 3. shoves them all to the beginning of the spreadsheet ahead of "the rest" of the columns _("the rest" being something it also computed dynamically)_

Code:

```python
import pandas
pandas.set_option('expand_frame_repr', False)

df = pandas.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypancsv/pypancsv/master/docs/_data/tallypivotoutput.csv', dtype=object)

print('---At first, "df" looks like this:---')
print(df)

columnsWithProgramInTheName = [x for x in df.columns if 'Program' in x]
theRestOfTheColumns = [x for x in df.columns if x not in columnsWithProgramInTheName]

newColumnOrder = columnsWithProgramInTheName + theRestOfTheColumns
df = df[newColumnOrder]

renamingMap = {x:x.replace('Program','') for x in columnsWithProgramInTheName}
df = df.rename(columns=renamingMap)

print()
print('---After reordering and renaming dynamically, "df" looks like this:---')
print(df)
```

Output:

```
---At first, "df" looks like this:---
