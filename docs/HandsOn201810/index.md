Thanks for coding for THREE HOURS with me on a sunny Saturday!

### Session Recording

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
> 
> The links have changed!  The links in the session recording are no longer guaranteed to be accurate!  If they no longer work, or seem to be doing something different, it's because I reused them for another presentation!
> 
> Replacement links are available with a "201810-" after the "sfpy" but before the rest of the URL.
> 
> So .../sfpyhello becomes .../sfpy201810-hello and .../sfpyhello-b becomes .../sfpy201820-hello-b
