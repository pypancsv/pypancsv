# CSV Processing with Python and Pandas

Welcome!

This site is meant to support my evangelization of Python as a "power tool" for CSV-file processing that isn't much harder to learn than writing fancy Excel formulas is -- and certainly simpler to learn than writing Excel VisualBasic macros by hand.

## Presentation Slide Examples

If you're here after watching a presentation, visit [Quick Examples](quickexamples){:target="_blank"} to review sample code from the presentation and run it yourself.

## Common "Operations"

If you've worked your way through the examples and want to practice modifying them, visit my list of [operations commonly used for CSV processing](quickexamples){:target="_blank"} to learn more functions that you can put into your Python scripts.
