# CSV Processing with Python and Pandas

Welcome!

This site is meant to support my evangelization of Python as a "power tool" for CSV-file processing that isn't much harder to learn than writing fancy Excel formulas is -- and certainly simpler to learn than writing Excel VisualBasic macros by hand.

## Presentation Slide Examples

If you're here after watching a presentation, visit [Quick Examples](quickexamples){:target="_blank"} to:

* Review sample code from the presentation
* Run it yourself
* Test your ability to edit the examples to do something else

## Common "Operations"

If you've worked your way through the examples and want a further challenge, visit my list of [operations commonly used for CSV processing](commonoperations){:target="_blank"} to learn more functions that you can put into your Python scripts.

For example, maybe instead of filtering for rows whose "Last Name starts with capital S" you want to...

* Look up what operation would "uppercase" the contents of cells in the "Last Name" column _(handy to do before checking if the output of that operation starts with capital S, so as to do a case-insensitive filter)_
* Look up what operation would check whether numeric cell values in an "Age" column are "< 60"
